## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor VBA code via excel from the provided stock data and to see if it could improve the efficency of the original code and ultimately determine which stock is worth investing.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary:
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Some advantages of refactoring code is that it may help reduce the run time of the program. This is because the code has been revised to be more concise and easier to read, which may also help with debugging. Some disadvantages is that sometimes it could be time consuming, especially if the data file is very large. New bugs can also be introduced when rewriting the code. Another disadvantage is when a different user refactors code and  interprets the original code differently,  the end result might not serve the same purpose that the original user intended. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
